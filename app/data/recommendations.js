    text: 'If there were a title for "Everyone\'s Favourite Mentor," Aayush would wear it with ease. At HyperVerge Academy, Aayush stood out not just for his energy and enthusiasm, but for the genuine care he brought to his role. He didn\'t just mentor, he showed up consistently and with heart. Aayush made every learner feel seen and supported. He knew them in and out- their fears, their wins, their quirks- and he used that understanding to guide them with empathy and clarity. It wasn\'t uncommon for learners from other batches to ask us why they couldn\'t have a mentor like him. That\'s the kind of impact he had. He went above and beyond, always. And in doing so, he reminded all of us what mentorship can look like when done with commitment and joy. If you\'re looking for someone who leads with passion, builds trust effortlessly, and uplifts those around him - Aayush is your person.',
